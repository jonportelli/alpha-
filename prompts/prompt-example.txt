I have a PRD for a front-end UI project using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.
I'd like to generate a comprehensive task list following these instructions:

1. Read through the PRD sections below
2. Break down the requirements into actionable development tasks
3. Follow these rules:
   - Break down UI components into atomic, reusable pieces
   - Design tasks should follow a mobile-first responsive approach
   - All components and functions should have proper TypeScript types defined
   - Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriate for the component type
   - Follow consistent patterns for Supabase CRUD operations and Auth

4. Format each task in this structure:
   - [ ] {task description} {priority emoji} {time estimate}
   
5. Group tasks by these categories:
   - Planning
   - Design System
   - Component Development
   - Page Layout
   - API Integration
   - Authentication
   - Testing
   - Performance Optimization
   - Documentation
